# My own Implementation of JavaScript in-built functions

In this Project, I have written my own implementation of the following JavaScript In-built Functions:

        1. map
        2. filter
        3. reduce
        4. forEach


Note : Each of the above function takes 2 parameters. They are, a list and a callback function that gets executed on the list.
